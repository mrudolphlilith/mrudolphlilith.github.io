<h3><span>Abstract</span></h3>

<p>In this chapter, we present different methods to analyze intracellular recordings and the testing of these 
methods using dynamic-clamp techniques. The methods are derived from a model of synaptic background activity 
where the synaptic membrane conductances are considered as stochastic processes. Because this <em>fluctuating 
point-conductance</em> model can be treated analytically, different methods can be outlined to estimate different 
characteristics of synaptic noise from the membrane potential (<em>V<sub>m</sub></em>) activity, such as the 
mean and variance of the excitatory and inhibitory conductance distributions (the <em>VmD method</em>) or 
spike-triggered averages of conductances. These analysis methods can be validated in controlled conditions 
using dynamic-clamp injection of known synaptic conductance patterns, as we illustrate here. Our approach 
constitutes a novel application of the dynamic clamp, which could be extended to the testing of other methods 
for extracting conductance information from the recorded <em>V<sub>m</sub></em> activity of neurons.</p>
